        Service is described in the Oxford English Dictionary as “the action of
        serving, helping, or benefiting; conduct tending to the welfare or
        advantage of another; condition or employment of a public servant;
        friendly or professional assistance.” Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate
        Dictionary, service is described as “the occupation or function of
        serving others; employment as a servant; contribution to the welfare of
        others.” Philip Kotler defines a service as, “Any act or performance
        that one party offers to another that is essentially intangible and does
        not result in the ownership of anything. Its production may or may not
        be tied to the physical product.” ADVERTISEMENTS: According to Kotler
        and Armstrong, “A service is an activity or benefit that one party can
        offer to another that is essentially intangible and does not result in
        the ownership of anything. Its production may or may not be tied to a
        physical product.” Explanation – Services are Intangible products such
        as accounting, banking, cleaning, consultancy, education, insurance,
        expertise, medical treatment, or transportation. Services deal with
        processes rather than with thing are experienced rather than consumed.
        According to Quinn, Gagnon, ‘Services are actually all those economic
        activities in which the primary output is neither a product nor a
        construction’. According to Kotle, ‘Any activity or benefit that one
        party can offer to another that is essentially intangible and does not
        result in the ownership of anything.’ ADVERTISEMENTS: According to
        Gronroos, ‘A service is an activity or series of activities of more or
        less intangible nature that normally, but not necessarily, take place in
        interactions between the customer and service employees and/or systems
        of the service provider, which are provided as solutions to customer
        problems.’ “Services are activities, benefits or satisfactions, which
        are offered for sale or are provided in connection with the sale of
        goods” – American Marketing Association “Services refer to social
        efforts, which include government to fight five great evils- wants,
        disease, ignorance, squalor and illness in the society”. – Sir William
        Bieveridge “A service is any activity or benefit that one party can
        offer to another which is essential intangible and does not result is
        the ownership of anything. Its production may or may not be tied to a
        physical product”. – Philip Kotler “The service is an activity that has
        an element of intangibility associated with it and involves the service
        provider’s interaction either with the customer or with the property
        belonging to the customer. The service does not involve the transfer of
        ownership of the output”. -Adrian Payne “Services are actually all those
        economic activities in which the primary output is neither a product nor
        a construction.” – Quinn, Gagnon ADVERTISEMENTS: “A service is and
        activity or series of activities of more or less intangible nature that
        normally, but not necessarily, take place in interactions between the
        customer and service employees and/or systems of the service provider,
        which are provided as solutions to customer problems.” – Gronroos
        “Services include all those economic activities that are intangible and
        imply interaction to be realized between a service provider and the
        consumer.” – Van Looy et al “Services are economic activities that
        create value and provide benefits to customers at specific times and
        places as a result of bringing about a desired change in or on behalf of
        the recipient of services.” – Lovelock “Services are separately
        identifiable, intangible activities which provide satisfaction when
        marketed to consumers and/or industrial users and which are not
        necessarily tied to the sale of a product or service.” – William J
        Stanton What is Service – The Concept In common parlance, the term can’t
        be only personal services like auto repairing, haircutting, services of
        dentists, legal consultants and so on. The marketing experts view the
        problem in a bit different way. They feel that the contents of services
        are much more-wider. There is no doubt in it that a number of experts
        have attempted to define the services but no single definition has been
        accepted universally. It is quite natural that as and when we attempt to
        clarify the perception, a number of comments crop up. According to US
        Government’s Standard Industrial Classification, “Establishments
        primarily providing a wide variety of services for individuals, business
        and government establishments and other organisations, hotels and other
        lodging places, establishments providing personal services, repair and
        amusement services, educational institutions, membership organisations
        and other miscellaneous services are included.” ADVERTISEMENTS: On the
        basis of the classification made by the Standard Industrial
        Classification, it is clear that different types of services are an
        important base for the services establishments offering services to both
        categories of customers, the individuals as well as the organisations.
        Another expert says, “Services refer to social efforts which include
        even government to fight five giant evils, e.g., want, disease,
        ignorance, squalor and illness in the society.” This opinion focuses on
        the organisations offering social services where hospitals or medicare
        or health centres, communication organisations, educational institutions
        are found important. Thus, the social efforts and the organisations
        taking part in the process are supposed to be studied in the very
        context. Another opinion throws light on human efforts. An expert says,
        “Services can also be defined as a human effort which provides succour
        to the needy. It may be food to a hungry person, water to a thirsty
        person, medical services to an ailing person and education to a student,
        loan to a farmer, transport to a consumer, communication aid to two
        persons who want to share a thought, pleasure or pain.” The definition
        given above clarifies that services are human efforts. The focus is on
        the point that services are not meant services for the sake of services
        or say, services without charging any fee. One expert says, “Services
        can also be defined an action(s) of organisation(s) that maintains and
        improves the well-being and functioning of people.”
