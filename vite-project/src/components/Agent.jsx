        What Is an Agent? An agent, in legal terminology, is a person who has
        been legally empowered to act on behalf of another person or an entity.
        An agent may be employed to represent a client in negotiations and other
        dealings with third parties. The agent may be given decision-making
        authority. Two common types of agents are attorneys, who represent their
        clients in legal matters, and stockbrokers, who are hired by investors
        to make investment decisions for them. The person represented by the
        agent in these scenarios is called the principal. In finance, it refers
        to a fiduciary relationship in which an agent is authorized to perform
        transactions on behalf of the client and in their best interest. KEY
        TAKEAWAYS An agent is authorized to act on behalf of another person,
        such as an attorney or a stockbroker. People hire agents to perform
        tasks that they lack the time or expertise to do for themselves. A
        universal agent has wide authority to act on another's behalf, but a
        general agent or special agent has more limited and specific powers.
        Agency by necessity is where an agent is appointed to act on behalf of a
        client who is physically or mentally incapable of making a decision.
        Most agent jobs require a license and registration with the appropriate
        state authorities. Understanding an Agent An agent is someone that is
        given permission (either explicitly or assumed) to act on an
        individual's behalf and may do so in a variety of capacities. This could
        include selling a home, executing a will, managing a sports career,
        managing an acting career, being a business representative, and so on.
        Agents often have expertise in a specific industry and are more
        knowledgeable about that industry's ins and outs than the average
        person. For example, if you started gaining attention as a musician, you
        would hire a music agent to help guide you through getting a record
        deal, signing record contracts, and arranging your touring schedule. As
        you would not have any experience with the record industry, you would
        need an agent to look out for your best interests and take care of a lot
        of the work that you would otherwise most likely not be able to complete
        on your own. This would also free up your time so that you can
        concentrate on making music. Types of Agents Agents come in all types
        depending on their function and the industry in which they operate. In
        general, there are three types of agents: universal agents, general
        agents, and special agents. Universal Agents Universal agents have a
        broad mandate to act on behalf of their clients. Often these agents have
        been given power of attorney for a client, which gives them considerable
        authority to represent a client in legal proceedings. They may also be
        authorized to make financial transactions on behalf of their clients.
        General Agents General agents are contracted to represent their clients
        in specific types of transactions or proceedings over a set period. They
        have broad authority to act but in a limited sphere. A talent agent for
        an actor would fall under this category. Special Agents Special agents
        are authorized to make a single transaction or a series of transactions
        within a limited period. This is the type of agent most people use from
        time to time. A real estate agent, securities agent, insurance agent,
        and travel agent are all special agents. Practicing as an agent in a
        specific industry without the proper license or registration can lead to
        fines or being prohibited from acting as an agent in that industry in
        the future. Before working as an agent, ensure that you have obtained
        the right license, certification, and registration. Uses of Agents
        People hire agents to perform tasks that they lack the time or expertise
        to do for themselves. Investors hire stockbrokers to act as middlemen
        between them and the stock market. Athletes and actors hire agents to
        negotiate contracts on their behalf because the agents are typically
        more familiar with industry norms and have a better idea of how to
        position their clients. More commonly, prospective homeowners use agents
        as middlemen, relying on the professional's greater skills at
        negotiation. Businesses often hire agents to represent them in a
        particular venture or negotiation, relying on the agents' superior
        skills, contacts, or background information to complete deals. Loyalty
        Responsibilities of an Agent Duty of Avoiding Material Benefit During
        the course of business, an agent may benefit. This is especially true
        when an agent is paid to perform a task on behalf of the principal. For
        example, a real estate agent commonly receives a commission for their
        work in selling a house. When acting on behalf of another, an agent must
        ensure they do not unjustly benefit from their agency position. This
        includes receiving large benefits from the relationship or taking
        advantage of their position to ensure they receive benefits that would
        not normally as part of a normal transaction.
